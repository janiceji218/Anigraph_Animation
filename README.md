# Assignment7

The core part of Assignment 7 will consist of 2 parts:
1. First, you will implement Bezier Spline interpolation for keyframed properties in AniGraph
    - This will not require much code, but will require you to work through what it means to apply spline interpolation to different properties using 2D time-value controls.
    - This code will be written entirely in the file `code/classes/interpolation/ABezierInterpolator.js`
    
2. We will ask you to create a few simple example animations based on some of the basic principles of animation.

If you are looking at this repo on Friday: we will replace this with more specific instructions tomorrow and release a video demo for the assignment.
In the meantime, we are releasing the system for you to try out. Animation should be functional, but before you complete your Bezier spline code it will perform linear interpolation.
